Computes rarefied estimates of convex hull volume
(i.e., the n-dimensional volume of the convex hull containing
a set of observations).

The advantage of computing rarefied estimates of a parameter
is to account for differences in sample sizes.
This can be useful to compare estimates among groups.

n-dimensional convex hulls are not frequently used in geometric morphometrics
to quantify morphospace occupation
(but see Drake & Klingenberg 2010; Fruciano et al. 2012, 2014).
However, they can be useful to quantify the spread of the points
(observations, individuals) in multivariate (tangent shape) space.
Because of their own nature, they are obviously sensitive to outliers.
For this reason, rarefaction - as implemented here - is particularly useful
to compare patterns across groups.

\section{Notice}{

The function uses internally the package geometry, which should be installed
prior to using this function.
Notice also that computation of multidimensional convex hulls is computationally expensive
and that requires more observations (individuals) than variables.
For this reason, errors might be produced when using too small sample sizes and/or too many variables.
A solution for this is increasing sample sizes or performing dimensionality reduction
by using this approach only on a meaningful subset of principal components.
The function does NOT perform GPA on each rarefied sample
this may or may not make a difference in estimates.
In many cases, it will probably not make much difference.
