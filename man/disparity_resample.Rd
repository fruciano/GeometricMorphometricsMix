\usage{
disparity_resample(
  Data,
  group = NULL,
  n_resamples = 1000,
  statistic = "multivariate_variance",
  CI = 0.95,
  bootstrap_rarefaction = "bootstrap",
  sample_size = NULL,
  parallel = FALSE,
  ncores = NULL,
  progress = TRUE,
  ci_method = "percentile"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{A data frame, matrix, vector, or 3D array. Observations (specimens) must be in rows
(if a 3D array is supplied, the third dimension is assumed to index specimens).}

\item{group}{A factor or a vector indicating group membership (will be coerced to factor). If
`NULL` (default) a single analysis is performed on the full dataset.}

\item{n_resamples}{Number of resampling replicates (default 1000).}

\item{statistic}{Character string identifying the statistic to compute. One of
`"multivariate_variance"`, `"mean_pairwise_euclidean_distance"`, `"convex_hull_volume"`,
`"claramunt_proper_variance"`. Default is
`"multivariate_variance"`. Ignored for univariate data (vector input).}

\item{CI}{Desired two-sided confidence interval level (default 0.95) used for percentile
confidence intervals. When `CI = 1`, returns the full range of resampled values.}

\item{bootstrap_rarefaction}{Either `"bootstrap"` (default) for resampling with replacement, 
`"rarefaction"` for resampling without replacement, or `"rarefaction_with_replacement"` 
for resampling with replacement at a specified sample size.}

\item{sample_size}{Either `NULL` (default), a positive integer indicating the number of rows to
sample when `bootstrap_rarefaction` is `"rarefaction"` or `"rarefaction_with_replacement"`, 
or the character `"smallest"` to use the size of the smallest group (all groups rarefied to that size). 
If `"smallest"` is supplied but no groups are defined, an error is returned. Required (not `NULL`)
when `bootstrap_rarefaction` is `"rarefaction"` or `"rarefaction_with_replacement"`.}

\item{parallel}{Logical indicating whether to use parallel processing for resampling (default FALSE).}

\item{ncores}{Integer number of cores to use for parallel processing. If NULL, defaults to 
`parallel::detectCores() - 1`.}

\item{progress}{Logical indicating whether to show progress information (default TRUE).}

\item{ci_method}{Character string specifying confidence interval method. Currently only 
"percentile" is fully supported (default "percentile").}
}
\value{
A list containing:
 \describe{
   \item{chosen_statistic}{Character vector of length 1 with the human-readable name of the statistic used.}
   \item{results}{A data frame with columns `group`, `observed`, `CI_min`, `CI_max`. One row per group.}
   \item{resampled_values}{If a single group: numeric vector of length `n_resamples` with the resampled values.
     If multiple groups: a named list with one numeric vector (length `n_resamples`) per group.}
}

The returned object has class "disparity_resample" and comes with associated S3 methods for 
convenient display and visualization:
\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{print.disparity_resample}}: Prints a formatted summary of results including confidence interval overlap assessment for multiple groups
  \item \code{\link{plot.disparity_resample}}: Creates a confidence interval plot using ggplot2
}
}
\description{
Provides a unified interface to obtain resampled (bootstrap or rarefied)
estimates of several disparity / morphospace occupation statistics.
}
\details{
The function allows choosing among the following multivariate statistics:
\itemize{
 \item Multivariate variance (trace of the covariance matrix; sum of variances)
 \item Mean pairwise Euclidea
Plot method for disparity_resample objectstance
 \item Convex hull volume (n-dimensional)
 \item Claramunt proper variance (Claramunt 2010) based on a linear shrinkage covariance matrix
}

If the input `Data` is univariate (i.e., a vector), the analysis defaults to computing
the (univariate) variance within each group (the attribute `statistic` is ignored).

If `bootstrap_rarefaction=="bootstrap"`, the function performs resampling with replacement
(i.e., classical bootstrap) by sampling rows of the data matrix / data frame.

If `bootstrap_rarefaction=="rarefaction"`, the function performs resampling without replacement
at the sample size indicated in `sample_size` (numeric) or, if `sample_size=="smallest"`,
at the size of the smallest group (all groups are resampled to that size).
Rarefaction requires specifying a value to the attribute `sample_size`; an error is returned otherwise.

If `bootstrap_rarefaction=="rarefaction_with_replacement"`, the function performs resampling 
with replacement at the sample size indicated in `sample_size`. This is equivalent to 
choosing "bootstrap" with a specified `sample_size`.
}
\note{
Because of how the computation works, convex hull volume computation requires the number of observations (specimens) to be (substantially) greater than the number of variables (dimensions).
In case of shape or similar, consider using the scores along the first (few/several) principal components.
Sometimes errors are thrown due to near-zero components, in this case try reducing the number of principal components used.
Examples of use of this statistic with geometric morphometric data include Drake & Klingenberg 2010 (American Naturalist), Fruciano et al. 2012 (Environmental Biology of Fishes) and Fruciano et al. 2014 (Biological Journal of the Linnean Society).
Because of the sensitivity of this statistic to outliers, usually rarefaction is preferred to bootstrapping.

"Multivariate variance" is also called "total variance", "Procrustes variance" (in geometric morphometrics) and "sum of univariate variances".
Note how the computation here does not divide variance by sample size (other than the normal division performed in the computation of variances).

\section{Observed estimate}{

For bootstrap resampling the observed estimate reported is the statistic computed on the
original (non-resampled) data for each group. For rarefaction and rarefaction_with_replacement, 
because the purpose is to make groups comparable at a common (smaller) sample size, the observed 
estimate reported is the mean of the rarefied resampled values for that group (i.e., the mean 
across all rarefaction replicates).
}

\section{Input data types}{

`Data` can be a data frame, a matrix, a vector, or a 3D array of landmark coordinates
(e.g., p landmarks x k dimensions x n specimens). In the latter case, the array is converted
internally to a 2D matrix with specimens in rows and (landmark * dimension) variables in columns.
}

\section{Confidence intervals}{

When `CI = 1`, the function returns the full range (minimum and maximum) of the resampled 
values instead of confidence intervals. This can be useful for exploring the complete 
variability of the statistic.
