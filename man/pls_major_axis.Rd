\usage{
pls_major_axis(
  pls_object,
  new_data_x = NULL,
  new_data_y = NULL,
  axes_to_use = 1,
  scale_PLS = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pls_object}{object of class "pls_fit" obtained from the function pls}

\item{new_data_x, new_data_y}{(optional) matrices or data frames containing new data}

\item{axes_to_use}{number of pairs of PLS axes to use in the computation
(by default, this is performed only on the first axis)}

\item{scale_PLS}{logical indicating whether PLS scores for different blocks
should be scaled prior to computing the major axis}
}
\value{
The function outputs a list with the following elements (please, see the Details section for explanations on their sub-elements):
 \describe{
  \item{original_major_axis_projection}{For each PLS axis pair,
  results of the computation of major axis and projection of the original data on each axis}
  \item{original_major_axis_predictions_reversed}{Data obtained back-transforming the scores
  on the major axis into the original space (e.g., shape)}
  \item{new_data_results}{(only if new data has been provided) PLS scores for the new data,
  scores of the new data on the major axis, preditions for the new data back-transformed into the original space (e.g., shape)}
}
}
\description{
Project data on the major axis of PLS scores and
obtain associated predictions
}
\details{
This function acts on a pls_fit object obtained from the function pls.
More in detail, the function:
 \itemize{
  \item{Projects the original data onto the major axis for each pair of PLS axes (obtaining for each observation of the original data a score along this axis)}
  \item{For each observation (specimen) of the original data, obtains the shape predicted by its score along the major axis}
  \item{(optionally) If new data is provided, these data is first projected in the original PLS space and then the two operations above are performed on the new data}
}
A more in-depth explanation with a figure which allows for a more intuitive understanding
is provided in Fruciano et al 2020
The idea is to obtain individual-level estimates of the shape predicted by a PLS model.
This can be useful, for instance, to quantify to which extent the shape of a given individual from one group
resembles the shape that individual would have according to the model computed in another group.
This can be done by obtaining predictions with this function and then computing the distance between
the actual shape observed for each individual and its prediction obtained from this function.
This is, indeed, how this approach has been used in Fruciano et al 2020.

The function returns a list with two or three main elements which are themselves lists.
The most useful elements for the final user are highlighted in boldface.

\emph{original_major_axis_projection} is a list containing as many elements as specified in axes_to_use (default 1).
Each of this elements contains the details of the computation of the major axis
(as a PCA of PLS scores for a pair of axes), and in particular:
\itemize{
  \item{major_axis_rotation: }{eigenvector}
  \item{mean_pls_scores: }{the mean scores for that axis pair used in the computation}
  \item{pls_scale: }{the scaling factor used}
  \item{\strong{original_data_PLS_projection}: }{scores of the original data on the major axis}
}

\emph{original_major_axis_predictions_reversed} contains the predictions of the PLS model for the original data,
back-transformed to the original space (i.e., if the original data was shape, this will be shape).
If axes_to_use > 1, these predictions will be based on the major axis computed for all pairs of axes considered.
This element has two sub-elements:
\itemize{
\item{\strong{Block1}: }{prediction for block 1}
\item{\strong{Block2}: }{prediction for block 2}
}

\emph{new_data_results} is only returned when new data is provided and contains the results of the
analyses obtained using a previous PLS model on new data and, in particular:
\itemize{
\item{\strong{new_data_Xscores}: }{PLS scores of the new data using the old model for the first block}
\item{\strong{new_data_Yscores}: }{PLS scores of the new data using the old model for the second block}
\item{\strong{new_data_major_axis_proj}: }{Scores of the new data on the major axis computed
 using the PLS model provided in pls_object. If axes_to_use > 1, each column correspond to a separate major axis}
 \item{\strong{new_data_Block1_proj_prediction_revert}: }{Predictions for the Block1 of the new data
 obtained by first computing the major axis projections for the new data (as found in element new_data_major_axis_proj)
  and then back-transforming these projection to the original space (e.g., shape)}
 \item{\strong{new_data_Block2_proj_prediction_revert}: }{Predictions for the Block2 of the new data
 obtained by first computing the major axis projections for the new data (as found in element new_data_major_axis_proj)
  and then back-transforming these projection to the original space (e.g., shape)}
}
