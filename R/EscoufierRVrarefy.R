#' Rarefied version of Escoufier RV coefficient
#'
#' Computes a rarefied estimate of the Escoufier RV coefficient
#' to account for the dependence on sample size
#' of RV, so that RV can be compared among groups with
#' different number of observations (sample sizes)
#'
#' This function computes a rarefied estimate of Escoufier RV coefficient
#' as suggested by Fruciano et al 2013 - Plos One
#' This can be useful to compare RV among groups with the same variables
#' but different sample sizes (as RV depends on sample size, see Fruciano et al 2013,
#' where this procedure is described).
#' The idea is the one rarefies the two groups at the same sample size
#'
#' @section Notice:
#' the function does NOT perform GPA on each rarefied sample
#' this may or may not make a difference in estimates.
#' In many cases, it will probably not make much difference
#' (e.g., Fig. 2 in Fruciano et al 2013)

#' @section Citation:
#' If you use this function please cite both
#' Fruciano et al. 2013 (for using the rarefaction procedure)
#' and Escoufier 1973 (because the procedure is based on Escoufier RV)
#'
#' @param Block1,Block2 Matrices or data frames
#' containing each block of variables
#' (observations in rows, variables in columns).

#' @param samplesize sample size to which the rarefaction procedure is carried out
#'
#' @seealso \code{\link{EscoufierRV}}
#' @return The function outputs a list with the following elements:
#'  \describe{
#'   \item{Rarefied_RV}{Mean rarefied RV}
#'   \item{Quantiles}{2.5\%, 50\% (median) and 97.5\% percentiles of the rarefied RV}

#' Escoufier RV coefficient
#'
#' Computes the Escoufier RV coefficient
#'
#'
#' This function computes the usual version of the Escoufier RV coefficient (Escoufier, 1973),
#' which quantifies the level of association between two multivariate blocks
#' of variables. The function accepts two blocks of variables, either two data frames
#' or two matrices each of n observations (specimens) as rows.
#' The two blocks must have the same number of rows (specimens), but can have
#' different number of columns (variables, such as landmark coordinates).
#' The Escoufier RV has been shown (Fruciano et al. 2013) to be affected
#' by sample size so comparisons of groups (e.g., species, populations)
#' with different sample size should be avoided, unless steps are taken to account
#' for this problem
#'
#' @param Block1,Block2 Matrices or data frames
#' containing each block of variables
#' (observations in rows, variables in columns).
#'
#' @return The function returns a number, corresponding to the Escoufier RV coefficient
