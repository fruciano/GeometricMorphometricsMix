#' Test the significance of the adjusted Rand index
#'
#' Permutation test of the adjusted Rand index, which quantifies the level of agreement
#' between two partitions (e.g., two schemes of classification of the same individuals obtained with two methods)
#'
#' The adjusted Rand index (Hubert and Arabie 1985), is an adjusted for chance version of the Rand index (Rand 1971).
#' The adjusted Rand index has an expected value of zero in the case of random partitions,
#' and values approaching one as the two partitions become more similar to each other
#' (with one being perfect match of the classification).
#'  This function implements the permutation test proposed by Qannari et al. (2014)
#' to obtain a p value against the null hypothesis of independence of the two partitions.
#'
#'
#' This function is useful in various contexts, such as in integrative taxonomy
#' when comparing the classification of individual specimens obtained using different data
#' (e.g., sequence data and morphometric data).
#' For an example of the application of this technique with the classification obtained with genetic data and
#' morphometric data for multiple traits, see Fruciano et al. 2016.
#'
#'
#' @section Notice:
#' The function requires internally the package mclust.
#'
#' @param A,B numerical or character vectors reflecting the assignment of individual observations to groups
#' @param perm number of permutations
#' @return The function outputs a vector with the adjusted Rand index and the p value obtained from the permutation test
#'
#' @section Citation:
#' If you use this function in the context of integrative taxonomy or similar
#' (comparison of classification/unsupervised clustering with biological data), please cite all the papers in the references
#' (otherwise, please use the relevant citations for the context).
