#' 'Reverse' PCA
#'
#' Obtain data in the original variables starting from PCA scores
#'
#' Given a set of PCA scores, a set of eigenvectors and the mean of the data on which
#' the PCA was originally computed, this function returns a set of observations in the
#' original data space.
#' This simple function can have many applications (not only in morphometrics) such as
#'  \itemize{
#'   \item Producing predicted shapes for extreme, unobserved, values of PC scores
#'   (e.g., the shape, or other set of variables, corresponding to 3 times the most
#'   extreme positive PC1 score), or their combinations (e.g., a value of 0.4 on PC1
#'   and 0.3 on PC2)
#'   \item Interpret results of analyses carried out on PC scores by converting these
#'   back to shapes
#' }
#'
#' @param Scores matrix n x s of n observation for s scores. Can be a single column
#' (for instance, if one is interested in PC1 only)
#' @param Eigenvectors matrix p x s of eigenvectors (as column eigenvectors);
#' notice that s (number of column eigenvectors) must be the same as the number of columns
#' of PC scores in Scores
#' @param Mean vector of length p with the multivariate mean computed on the original dataset
#' (the dataset on which the PCA was carried out)
#'
#' @return The function outputs a matrix n x p of the scores 'back-transformed'
#' into the original variables
